# Write a Python script to sort (ascending and descending) a dictionary by value.

**Notes:**
* Use operator module in python.
* Define two different functions
    * One to get ascending order of dict
    * Two to get descending order of dict.

For eg. Given dict {1: 2, 3: 4, 4: 3, 2: 1, 0: 0}

In Ascending order it should be: [(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3)]
In descending order it should be: [(4, 3), (3, 4), (2, 1), (1, 2), (0, 0)]
